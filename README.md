* Select Column List
* ***Group By***
* Having
* Order By

### 9. What happens if a numeric value is given as a parameter to the count function?
* ***It will show the count of rows***
* The select statement fails to execute

### 10. The Exists operator will understand____ type of value
* ***Boolean***
* Integer

### 11. The user does not have the privilege of select on a table. The user issues a select statement on that table. Which clause will throw error?
* Where
* Having
* ***From***
* Order By

### 12. The column alias can be used in_____
* ***Order By***

# Tracing Query Execution Techniques
### 1. The output of Explain is stored in a table known as Plan_Table
* ***True***
* False

### 2. Explain Plan output may not practically be correct always.
* ***True***
* False

### 3. Checking SQL statement syntax is done while executing and not while compiling.
* True
* ***False***

### 4. Bind variable is session specific
* ***True***
* False

### 5. The sql statements Select * from Emp; and select * from emp; are same for hard parsing?
* Yes
* ***No***

### 6. To eliminate the hard parsing again what is used.
* Substitution Variable
* ***Bind Variable***
* PLSQL Package variable
* A Local PLSQL variable

### 7. -- The --- dynamic view is used to see the parsing details
* V$parse
* ***V$sql***

### 8. In which parsing the syntax of a sql statement is checked?
* Soft parse
* ***Hard Parse***

### 9. The____needs DBA privilege.
* ***AutoTrace***
* Explain Plan

### 10. Explain plan neither executes the query nor automatically queries the plan table.
* ***True***
* False

### 11. The heavy data loading has not happened. Some small volume of data is dumped in the tables. Only the indexing and structure is ready. Which is a good way to know the execution?
* AutoTrace
* ***Explain Plan***

### 12. For knowing the execution details Explain Plan is an initial activity to be done whereas AutoTrace is the activity to be done later
* ***True***
* False


# Query Optimization - Indexes

* ***True***
* False

### 5. Index is not required if the query is going to access 95% rows of the table.
* ***True***
* False

### 6. In the Auto trace output if Oracle shows that index is used then which keyword comes for the where clause column condition?
* ***Access***

* B-Tree
* ***Bitmap***

* ***True***
* False

### 3. We have redundant formula to be used in several new formula-based columns. What would be the best way of doing it?
* Use a temporary table
* ***Use an inline view***

### 4. Can we give multiple hints to the Oracle optimizer?
* ***Yes***
* No

### 5. In peak hours the records of the main tables get locked. What can be done to access those records even in the peak hours?
* Create Inline Views
* ***Add those records in a temporary table before peak hour***
